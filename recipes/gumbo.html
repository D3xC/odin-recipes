    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Gumbo (Louisiana Creole: Gombo) is a soup popular in the U.S. state of Louisiana, and is
      the official state cuisine. Gumbo consists primarily of a strongly-flavored stock, meat or
      shellfish, a thickener, and the Creole "holy trinity" ― celery, bell peppers, and onions.
      Gumbo is often categorized by the type of thickener used, whether okra or filé powder (dried
      and ground sassafras leaves).</p>
    <p>The dish combines ingredients and culinary practices of several cultures, including African,
      French, Spanish, and Native American Choctaw. Gumbo may have been based on traditional native
      dishes, or may be a derivation of the French dish bouillabaisse, or Choctaw stew, but most
      likely all of these dishes contributed to the original recipe. It was first described in 1802,
      and was listed in various cookbooks in the latter half of the 19th century. The dish gained
      more widespread popularity in the 1970s, after the United States Senate dining room added it to
      the menu in honor of Louisiana Senator Allen Ellender. The popularity of chef Paul Prudhomme
      in the 1980s spurred further interest in the dish.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 pound bacon, to make 1 cup bacon grease</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons olive oil , (or bacon grease)</li>
      <li>1 yellow onion, chopped</li>
      <li>1 red bell pepper, chopped</li>
      <li>2 cups andouille sausage, sliced</li>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/2 can beer</li>
      <li>4-6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>3/4 gallon chicken stock, (96 ounces)</li>
      <li>1 15- ounce can chopped tomatoes, (or 1 cup fresh tomatoes, chopped)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar</li>
      <li>2 cups stewed and shredded chicken</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons fresh parsley</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon dried basil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>2 cups frozen okra</li>
      <li>2 cups crab meat</li>
      <li>Kosher salt, white pepper, lemon juice & Tabasco, to taste</li>
      <li>Chopped green onions & rice, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat a large cast iron skillet on medium high heat and cook the bacon, set
        the bacon aside to drain and measure the bacon renderings to 1 cup and reserve
        the rest for cooking the vegetables or another use. If you don't have enough
        bacon renderings melt enough butter to add to the bacon grease to make one cup.</li>
      <li>Add 3 tablespoons olive oil or bacon grease to the cast iron skillet you
        cooked the bacon in and cook the onion and bell pepper until soft and set aside.</li>
      <li>Cook the sausage in the same skillet until browned and set aside with the vegetables.</li>
      <li>Add the 1 cup of the bacon fat to the skillet over medium heat and stir in the
        flour. Lower the heat to low and cook for at least 1 hour, stirring every 5 minutes.
        The roux should be thick, but not chalky. A little grease will probably separate
        from the roux while cooking. When it is dark tan and smells like toasted nuts, it
        is done. Caution: The roux burns easily so watch it very carefully and stir often.</li>
      <li>In a large stock pot or dutch oven, add the sautéed vegetables and sausage and
        heat over medium high heat. Add the beer and stir to blend. Add the garlic and simmer
        for 2 minutes. Add stock, tomatoes, vinegar, chicken, and all other dry ingredients.
        Simmer on low to medium heat for at least 1 hour.</li>
      <li>Add salt, white pepper, lemon juice and Tabasco to taste.</li>
      <li>Skim off about 3 cups of liquid from pot (with as few solids as possible) and
        combine in a bowl with about 1 cup roux. Stir until it thickens and becomes paste-like.
        Add about half this mixture back to pot on low heat. Stir well. Let simmer for a few
        minutes and add more roux mixture to thicken or water or stock to thin. The gumbo
        should be thick, but not as thick as gravy.</li>
      <li>Add half of the okra. Simmer on very low for at least 30 minutes. Be careful, as it
        can easily burn. Add the remaining cup of okra and the crab meat 5 minutes before serving.</li>
      <li>Taste again for salt, white pepper, lemon juice and Tabasco. Serve in bowls with rice
        and garnish with green onion.</li>
    </ol>
