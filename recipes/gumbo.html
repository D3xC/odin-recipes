        <p><strong>Gumbo</strong> (Louisiana Creole: Gombo) is a soup popular in the U.S. state of Louisiana, and is
          the official state cuisine. Gumbo consists primarily of a strongly-flavored stock, meat or
          shellfish, a thickener, and the Creole "holy trinity" ― celery, bell peppers, and onions.
          Gumbo is often categorized by the type of thickener used, whether okra or filé powder (dried
          and ground sassafras leaves).</p>
        <p>The dish combines ingredients and culinary practices of several cultures, including African,
          French, Spanish, and Native American Choctaw. Gumbo may have been based on traditional native
          dishes, or may be a derivation of the French dish bouillabaisse, or Choctaw stew, but most
          likely all of these dishes contributed to the original recipe. It was first described in 1802,
          and was listed in various cookbooks in the latter half of the 19th century. The dish gained
          more widespread popularity in the 1970s, after the United States Senate dining room added it to
          the menu in honor of Louisiana Senator Allen Ellender. The popularity of chef Paul Prudhomme
          in the 1980s spurred further interest in the dish.</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol class="steps">
          <li class="step">Heat a large cast iron skillet on medium high heat and cook the bacon, set
            the bacon aside to drain and measure the bacon renderings to 1 cup and reserve
            the rest for cooking the vegetables or another use. If you don't have enough
            bacon renderings melt enough butter to add to the bacon grease to make one cup.</li>
          <li class="step">Add 3 tablespoons olive oil or bacon grease to the cast iron skillet you
            cooked the bacon in and cook the onion and bell pepper until soft and set aside.</li>
          <li class="step">Cook the sausage in the same skillet until browned and set aside with the vegetables.
          </li>
          <li class="step">Add the 1 cup of the bacon fat to the skillet over medium heat and stir in the
            flour. Lower the heat to low and cook for at least 1 hour, stirring every 5 minutes.
            The roux should be thick, but not chalky. A little grease will probably separate
            from the roux while cooking. When it is dark tan and smells like toasted nuts, it
            is done. Caution: The roux burns easily so watch it very carefully and stir often.</li>
          <li class="step">In a large stock pot or dutch oven, add the sautéed vegetables and sausage and
            heat over medium high heat. Add the beer and stir to blend. Add the garlic and simmer
            for 2 minutes. Add stock, tomatoes, vinegar, chicken, and all other dry ingredients.
            Simmer on low to medium heat for at least 1 hour.</li>
          <li class="step">Add salt, white pepper, lemon juice and Tabasco to taste.</li>
          <li class="step">Skim off about 3 cups of liquid from pot (with as few solids as possible) and
            combine in a bowl with about 1 cup roux. Stir until it thickens and becomes paste-like.
            Add about half this mixture back to pot on low heat. Stir well. Let simmer for a few
            minutes and add more roux mixture to thicken or water or stock to thin. The gumbo
            should be thick, but not as thick as gravy.</li>
          <li class="step">Add half of the okra. Simmer on very low for at least 30 minutes. Be careful, as it
            can easily burn. Add the remaining cup of okra and the crab meat 5 minutes before serving.</li>
          <li class="step">Taste again for salt, white pepper, lemon juice and Tabasco. Serve in bowls with rice
            and garnish with green onion.</li>
