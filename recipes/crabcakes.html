        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A crab cake is a variety of fishcake that is popular in the United States. It is
            composed of crab meat and various other ingredients, such as bread crumbs, mayonnaise,
            mustard (typically prepared mustard, but sometimes mustard powder), eggs, and
            seasonings. The cake is then saut√©ed, baked, grilled, deep fried, or broiled. Crab
            cakes are traditionally associated with the area surrounding the Chesapeake Bay, in
            particular the states of Maryland and Virginia. Although the earliest use of the
            term "crab cake" is commonly believed to date to Crosby Gaige's 1939 publication
            New York World's Fair Cook Book in which they are described as "Baltimore crab cakes,"
            earlier usages can be found such as in Thomas J. Murrey's book Cookery with a Chafing
            Dish published in 1891.[4]</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds fresh jumbo lump crabmeat, picked over for shells and cartilage</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups panko</li>
            <li>1/2 cup mayonnaise</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped chives</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons seafood seasoning, such as Old Bay</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>Juice and zest of 1 lemon, plus more lemon wedges for serving</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.</li>
            <li>For the crab cakes: Gently fold together the crabmeat, breadcrumbs, mayonnaise,
                chives, Dijon mustard, seafood seasoning, 1 teaspoon kosher salt, 1 teaspoon
                freshly ground pepper and the juice and zest of one lemon in a large bowl.
                Refrigerate the crab mixture for 15 minutes to firm up; this allows the breadcrumbs
                to absorb some of the liquid, helping the crab cakes bind together.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make the tartar sauce: Combine the mayonnaise, dill pickles, capers,
                chives, zest and juice of 1 lemon in a medium bowl and mix until combined.
                Season to taste with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.</li>
            <li>Scoop heaping half cups of the crab mixture and pat into 2 1/2-inch wide
                patties. Lightly press them together so they do not fall apart while cooking.
                You should have 8 patties.</li>
            <li>Heat 3 tablespoons unsalted butter and 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large nonstick
                skillet over medium-high heat. Add the crab cakes to the pan and cook until golden,
                about 2 minutes, then flip using a flat metal spatula. Continue to cook until lightly
                golden, about 1 1/2 minutes then transfer the pan to the oven. Cook until the crab
                cakes are completely heated through, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve the crab cakes with the tartar sauce and lemon wedges.</li>
        </ol>
